        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><em>Oyakodon</em> is a traditional Japanese recipe that is simple to make and
        delicious to taste. The name of the dish literally translates to <strong>"Mother
        and Child Bowl"</strong>, which is a cheeky reference to the two main ingredients:
        chicken and eggs. <em>Oyakodon</em> is considered to be Japanese comfort food, and
        it is a favorite among children and adults.</p>
        <p><em>Oyakodon</em> belongs to a group of Japanese recipes called <strong>"donburi"</strong>, which
        are basically rice bowls with various toppings. Other common donburi include
        <em>gyuudon</em>, a sweet and savory beef dish, and <em>katsudon</em>, which comes with a fried
        pork cutlet.</p>
