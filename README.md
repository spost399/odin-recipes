The Odin Project - Recipe Site Project

This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. In this project
I demonstrate basic HTML skills including: creating an HTML boilerplate,
formatting text using paragraph, heading, and break tags, using absolute and
relative links to pages and images, and creating ordered and unordered lists.
